NestJS Component Types (Detailed):

1. Controllers
    - In few words: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
    - Purpose: Handle incoming HTTP requests, map routes to methods, and return responses to the client.
    - Decorators: @Controller(), @Get(), @Post(), @Put(), @Delete(), etc.
    - Example:
        @Controller('users')
        export class UsersController {
            @Get()
            findAll() { /* ... */ }
        }

2. Providers
    - In few words: Providers are the ones that create the classes that are injected into controllers.
    - Purpose: Encapsulate business logic, data access, and utility functions. Includes services, repositories, and helpers.
    - Decorators: @Injectable()
    - Example:
        @Injectable()
        export class UsersService {
            findAll() { /* ... */ }
        }

3. Modules
    - In few words: Modules group related controllers and providers for modular architecture.
    - Purpose: Group related controllers, providers, and other modules. Enable modular architecture.
    - Decorators: @Module()
    - Example:
        @Module({
            controllers: [UsersController],
            providers: [UsersService],
        })
        export class UsersModule {}

4. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
    - In few words: DTOs define the shape and validation of data sent in requests and responses.
    - Purpose: Define the structure and validation rules for data sent in requests and responses.
    - Usage: Used with validation pipes for input validation.
    - Example:
        export class CreateUserDto {
            name: string;
            email: string;
        }

5. Guards
    - In few words: Guards control access to routes based on authorization logic.
    - Purpose: Control access to routes based on authorization logic (e.g., roles, permissions, authentication).
    - Decorators: @UseGuards()
    - Example:
        @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
        @Get('profile')
        getProfile() { /* ... */ }

6. Interceptors
    - In few words: Interceptors add logic before/after method execution (e.g., logging, transforming responses).
    - Purpose: Add logic before/after method execution (e.g., logging, transforming responses, caching).
    - Decorators: @UseInterceptors()
    - Example:
        @UseInterceptors(LoggingInterceptor)
        @Get()
        findAll() { /* ... */ }

7. Pipes
    - In few words: Pipes transform and validate incoming request data.
    - Purpose: Transform and validate incoming request data before it reaches the route handler.
    - Decorators: @UsePipes()
    - Example:
        @UsePipes(ValidationPipe)
        @Post()
        create(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto) { /* ... */ }

8. Filters (Exception Filters)
    - In few words: Filters handle and customize error responses.
    - Purpose: Handle and customize error responses. Catch exceptions thrown by controllers or services.
    - Decorators: @UseFilters()
    - Example:
        @UseFilters(HttpExceptionFilter)
        @Get()
        findAll() { /* ... */ }

9. Middleware
    - In few words: Middleware executes code before the request reaches controllers.
    - Purpose: Execute code before the request reaches controllers (e.g., logging, authentication, request modification).
    - Usage: Applied at the application or route level.
    - Example:
        app.use(loggerMiddleware);

10. Loggers
     - In few words: Loggers provide logging for debugging and monitoring.
     - Purpose: Provide logging for debugging, monitoring, and auditing application behavior.
     - Usage: Use built-in Logger or custom loggers.
     - Example:
         Logger.log('User created');

11. Auth (Authentication Strategies)
     - In few words: Auth implements authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
     - Purpose: Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth, local). Often use Passport strategies.
     - Decorators: @UseGuards()
     - Example:
         @UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'))
         @Get('profile')
         getProfile() { /* ... */ }

Summary:
Each NestJS component type serves a specific role in structuring, securing, validating, and handling application logic, making applications modular, maintainable, and scalable.
